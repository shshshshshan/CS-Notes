    "## Sample Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are given two string, $s$ and $t$. Calculate the number of edits need to match these two strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Example*\n",
    "\n",
    "|String $s$|String $t$|Edits|\n",

    "## What You Can Do\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do three things for each case:\n",
    "  1. **Insert** - You can insert a letter into $s$ in the hopes of matching the two strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "  > **Important**: This move is equivalent to deleting a letter in $t$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  2. **Substitute** - You can change a letter of $s$ to match it with $t$.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  3. **Delete** - You can delete a letter from $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "  > **Important**: This move deletes a letter from $s$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Example*\n",
    "\n",
    "Given string $s$ `'a cat!'` and string $t$ `'the cats!'`. Suppose we start at the end of the two strings when comparing, the following are the principles for the actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Insert\n",
    "At the $i$-th iteration where the two strings mismatch, the strings would be `'a cat'` and `'the cats'`. <br>\n",
    "Inserting at this point will yield the strings `'a cats'` and `'the cats'`, which is essentially equal to `'a cat'` and `'the cat'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Why?** Why deleting from $t$ instead of keeping the inserted letter? The reason is that it can be ambiguous where to insert in $s$. If the letter should be inserted **before** the $i$-th letter or **after**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Substitute\n",
    "At the $i$-th iteration where the two strings mismatch, the strings would be `'a cat'` and `'the cats'`. <br>\n",
    "Substituting at this point will yield the strings `'a cas'` and `'the cats'`, in hopes of matching the two $i$-th letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Delete\n",
    "At the $i$-th iteration where the two strings mismatch, the strings would be `'a cat'` and `'the cats'`. <br>\n",
    "Deleting at this point will yield the strings `'a ca'` and `'the cats'`. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Notes\n",
    "It is important to take note that, though, you, as a person, can easily determine which action or operation to do, the computer is not knowledgable of this. In fact, it does not know which of the two strings are lengthier.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important that the strings can get so complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Algorithm\n",
    "The algorithm is based off of a paradigm called **Dynamic Programming**, shortened to **DP**. DP essentially optimizes a slow algorithm into a better one. It also tries to find the minimal effort - or a more formal term, **cost** - of a certain algorithm. DP can also be called **Discrete Optimization**."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of the `countEditDistance` function is exponential, specifically $O(3^{\\max{(m, n)}})$. This is due to the recursive nature of the function where each subproblem generates up to three more subproblems without memoization to avoid redundant calculations. In practical applications, this approach is inefficient for large strings and would benefit greatly from dynamic programming with memoization to reduce the time complexity to polynomial time $O(m \\times n)$."
